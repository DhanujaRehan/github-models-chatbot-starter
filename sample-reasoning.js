/**
 * COMPLEX REASONING AND PROBLEM SOLVING DEMONSTRATION
 * 
 * This file showcases the advanced reasoning capabilities of the o1-preview model by presenting
 * various complex scenarios that require deep thinking and logical analysis. The application:
 * 1. Provides a menu of challenging reasoning scenarios (math, logic, ethics, problem-solving)
 * 2. Allows users to select which type of reasoning challenge to present to the AI
 * 3. Uses the o1-preview model specifically designed for complex reasoning tasks
 * 4. Cleans up markdown formatting from responses for better readability
 * 
 * Key concepts demonstrated:
 * - Advanced reasoning model usage (o1-preview vs standard GPT-4o)
 * - Interactive scenario selection with user-friendly menus
 * - Text processing utilities for cleaning AI responses
 * - Complex problem scenarios that test different types of reasoning:
 *   - Mathematical calculations and analysis
 *   - Logical puzzles and deduction
 *   - Ethical dilemmas and moral reasoning
 *   - Resource allocation and optimization problems
 * 
 * This demonstrates how specialized reasoning models can tackle problems requiring
 * multi-step thinking, logical deduction, and complex analysis.
